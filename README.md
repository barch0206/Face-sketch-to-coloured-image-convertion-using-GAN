# Face sketch(grayscale) is converted to RGB image
- Implementing a Generative Adversarial Network to add colour to images in grayscale,aka:black and white images
- CUHK dataset used
- 188 images used for training and 100 images used for testing
- the GAN model trained for 100 epochs using GAN.ipynb 
- Predict_Image.ipynb can be used for getting the GAN's coloured output for any sketch fetches as input
